This requires a UNIX operating system (For starters, an Ubuntu Linux will do).
If you are on Windows, you can also use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
I don't explain here how to install it, but you can follow the official
[Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
It seems now this should be as easy as opening a Windows terminal as admin
and running the command 
```
wsl --install
```
In any case, please refer to the previous guide if something goes wrong.
In particular, if your computer doesn't have virtualization enabled by
default, you might struggle installing WSL. You should enable this
virtualization for it to work. This [Microsoft link](
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1
) might be a good start on how to do it.

## LPJmL model installation and usage

1. You will need a local LPJmL model installation. You can clone from the
    [official LPJmL repository](https://github.com/PIK-LPJmL/LPJmL) or from
    [my fork](https://github.com/lbm364dl/LPJmL) (which has some custom config
    for our needs). You can run the following commands to get the model project
    in your home folder, in a folder called LPJmL:
    ```bash
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/lbm364dl/LPJmL
    cd LPJmL
    ```
    Before installing the model, you might need some operating system
    dependencies. For that, run the following command to install them (at
    least these were the ones I needed):
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libjson-c-dev libnetcdf-dev libudunits2-dev
    ```
    From inside the model's folder (you should already be if you followed
    previous commands), you now need to run these commands in order to install
    the model:
    ```bash
    ./configure.sh -noerror
    make all
    ```

2. You will also need the inputs for the model. For now the basic inputs
    can be downloaded from
    [here](https://saco.csic.es/s/nrJ3JGPZyZeQMW8?path=%2FData).
    You have to download the `LPJmL5-real-inputs.zip` file, extract it and
    add it as a subfolder called `inputs` inside the `LPJmL` model folder you
    got in previous step. After downloading, you can do this from the terminal.
    First make sure you have `unzip` installed:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```
    You can now use this command if you are on Linux:
    ```bash
    unzip ~/Downloads/LPJmL5-real-inputs.zip -d ~/LPJmL/inputs
    ```
    If you are on WSL, you can also get the zip downloaded on Windows directly
    to Linux (note the place we get the file from in the command, change
    username to your user in Windows):
    ```bash
    unzip /mnt/c/Users/username/Downloads/LPJmL5-real-inputs.zip -d ~/LPJmL/inputs
    ```
    In the previous command, if you don't know your Windows username you can
    find it by using the command
    ```bash
    powershell.exe '$env:UserName'
    ```

3. The model is best run concurrently, i.e., using more than one core
    of your CPU. You can still run only on one core by setting the number of
    cores, but by default the code will need anyway a program called `mpirun`
    to work. You can install everything with the command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
    ```

4. Install R. There are ways to do this in a terminal. The cleanest way for
    me is to use [`rig`](https://github.com/r-lib/rig), an R version manager,
    which allows an easy installation of new versions and also switching
    between them if needed. It can be installed with these commands (copied
    from the previous link):
    ```bash
    sudo curl -L https://rig.r-pkg.org/deb/rig.gpg -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/rig.gpg
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://rig.r-pkg.org/deb rig main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rig.list'
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install r-rig
    ```
    Now installing the latest R version is as easy as this:
    ```bash
    rig add release
    ```
    If you realized this tool is extremely useful, you can learn more from
    their page (previous link).

5. The previous steps were preparations for the actual raw `C` language model.
    The `R` package `lpjmlkit` allows running the model a bit easier from `R`,
    but internally it runs the model you downloaded and installed before. For
    running the helper scripts found here, you can first get all the
    dependencies easily by using `renv`. First make sure to install some
    dependencies for `terra` R package:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
    ```
    You can now go into this repository's folder. If you haven't done it yet,
    you should clone this repository:
    ```bash
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/lbm364dl/test-lpjmlkit
    ```
    Now, you can open your R session in this folder with the commands:
    ```bash
    cd ~/test-lpjmlkit
    R
    ```
    You can now just do `renv::restore()` and you should be ready. If you
    don't know about using `renv` you can check
    [my guide](https://lbm364dl.github.io/follow-the-workflow/renv.html).

6. The code to run the model using the `lpjmlkit` package and get an idea of
    how to configure it further to your needs is found in `lpjmlkit.R`. It
    takes as default config the one found in the LPJmL model folder in
    `lpjml_config.cjson`, which already includes things like our own input
    files paths (if you cloned my fork instead of the official one). This
    default config can be overwritten, and examples can be seen in
    `lpjmlkit.R`. From the R session, you can run by doing
    ```r
    source("lpjmlkit.R")
    ```
    You should get an error here if you haven't set your custom path for the
    LPJmL model in the `lpjmlkit.R` file. There are ways to edit files inside
    the terminal, but if you like using Rstudio, it would make sense to have
    it here too. If you are on WSL and you want to use Rstudio, you can't
    easily use the Rstudio Desktop installed on your Windows. Instead, you
    should install another one in WSL itself. First, if you were still inside
    the R session, you can leave it by writing `quit()` and choosing not to
    save your session. Now you should be again in Bash (the Linux terminal).
    To install Rstudio here, use these commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
    curl -o rstudio.deb https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/jammy/amd64/rstudio-2025.05.0-496-amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i rstudio.deb
    sudo apt-get -f install
    ```
    You can open it from the terminal with the command:
    ```bash
    rstudio
    ```
    After doing this once, you should probably find a shorcut on your Windows
    if you search apps. The name should be something like
    `Rstudio (Ubuntu-24.04)`, as opposed to the usual `Rstudio` (if you also
    had it installed on Windows). From here on, you are probably safe to just
    open that, since Rstudio's terminal will by default also be the WSL
    terminal there.

7. The outputs of the model can also be customized. I haven't done this yet, but
    you will get the default output results in a folder called `simulation` inside
    the `LPJmL` folder. We can then read and play with these NetCDF outputs (see
    `read_output.R`).

There is still a lot to experiment with. If you want to try other config tweaks,
I suggest going through the files `lpjml_config.cjson` and `input.cjson`, and
all those in the `par` folder. All of them are in the `LPJmL` model folder.

You can also read more about the `lpjmlkit` package itself in their two
vignettes, which you can access writing in R:
```r
vignette("lpjml-runner")
vignette("lpjml-data")
```
